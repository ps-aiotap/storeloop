**SHOW:** Customer registration page

## 👤 Customer Registration (0:15-1:00)

## 🛒 Multi-Address Checkout (1:00-2:00)

**SHOW:**
- Go to any store and click "Buy Now" on a product
- Show checkout modal with:
  - Place Order button at top
  - Product details with quantity selector
  - Address selection: "Use saved address" vs "Add new address"

- Show adding a new address during checkout

## 🏗️ Database Architecture (2:00-2:45)

**SAY:** *"This is proper database design - User table linked to UserAddress table, and Orders linked to specific addresses via foreign keys. Not text fields like other platforms use."*

*"I built a migration script that converted existing order addresses into proper UserAddress records, maintaining data integrity while upgrading the architecture."*

**SHOW:**
- Show the address selection working
- Demonstrate multiple addresses for same customer
- Show how orders link to specific addresses
