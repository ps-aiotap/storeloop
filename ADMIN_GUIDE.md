## Excel/CSV Product Upload

Bulk product import saves time for artisans with large catalogs.

### Preparing Upload File

**Required Columns**:
- `name`: Product name (Hindi/English)
- `description`: Detailed description
- `price`: Price in INR (numbers only)
- `stock`: Available quantity
- `category`: Product category
- `image_url`: URL to product image (optional)
- `material`: Material used (for AI descriptions)
- `region`: Origin region (for AI descriptions)
- `style`: Style/type (for AI descriptions)

**Sample CSV**:
```csv
name,description,price,stock,category,material,region,style
"‡§¨‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§ø‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï ‡§∏‡§æ‡§°‡§º‡•Ä","Beautiful handwoven saree",15000,5,"Clothing","Silk","Varanasi","Traditional"
"‡§ï‡§∂‡•Ä‡§¶‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤","Embroidered woolen shawl",3500,10,"Accessories","Wool","Kashmir","Kashmiri"
```

### Upload Process

1. Navigate to `/stores/products/upload/`
2. Select CSV or Excel file
3. Click "Upload"
4. System validates each row:
   - Checks required fields
   - Validates data types
   - Reports errors with row numbers
5. Successful products are imported
6. Error summary provided for failed rows

### Validation Features
- **Row-level validation**: Each row processed independently
- **Error reporting**: Specific error messages with row numbers
- **Partial success**: Valid rows imported even if some fail
- **Upload history**: Track previous uploads and results

## AI Product Descriptions

**Important**: AI provides editable draft suggestions only - never auto-publishes content. All AI-generated content requires manual review and approval.

### How It Works

1. **Input Fields**:
   - Product name
   - Material (e.g., "Silk", "Clay", "Wood")
   - Region (e.g., "Varanasi", "Kashmir", "Rajasthan")
   - Style (e.g., "Traditional", "Contemporary", "Handwoven")

2. **AI Processing**:
   - Uses OpenRouter or Groq API
   - Generates both Hindi and English descriptions
   - Creates short (50 words) and long (150 words) versions

3. **Human Review**:
   - Descriptions appear as editable draft suggestions in text areas
   - User must review, edit, and approve before saving
   - AI provides assistance only - human creativity and approval required

### Using AI Descriptions

1. In product form, fill basic details
2. Click "Generate English Description" or "Generate Hindi Description"
3. Wait for AI processing (shows loading indicator)
4. Review generated text in form fields
5. Edit descriptions as needed
6. Save product with human-approved content

### API Configuration

**OpenRouter Setup**:
```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

**Groq Setup**:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

**Fallback**: If no API configured, system uses template-based descriptions.

## WhatsApp Notifications
