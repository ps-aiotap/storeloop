# üé¨ Loom Video Script - StoreLoop E-commerce Platform for Indian Artisans

**Duration: 6 minutes | Target: E-commerce Platform Development & Indian Market Gigs**

---

## üéØ Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)

_"Hi! I'm going to show you StoreLoop - a complete e-commerce platform I built specifically for Indian artisans and small businesses. It has zero transaction fees, Hindi language support, GST compliance, and advanced features like multi-address customer management that Wix and Shopify don't offer."_

**[Screen: Show StoreLoop homepage with beautiful artisan stores]**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/stores/`

---

## üîç Problem Statement (0:30-1:00)

_"Existing platforms weren't built for Indian artisans. Wix charges 2.9% transaction fees, has no Hindi interface, and requires 20+ setup steps. Shopify costs $29/month - more than many artisans make. WooCommerce needs WordPress expertise most craftspeople don't have."_

_"None understand Indian needs - GST compliance, Hindi product descriptions, or multi-address delivery for joint families."_

_"So I built StoreLoop - zero fees, 4-step onboarding, Hindi language support, and advanced customer management. Built specifically for India's creative economy."_

_"Let me show you the complete flow - from artisan onboarding to customer purchase with advanced features."_

**[Screen: Seller Onboarding Wizard]**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/stores/onboarding/`

**[Screen: Show 4-step wizard flow]**

- **Continue through onboarding steps 1-5**

_"Now let me show you product management - artisans can easily add products with Hindi names, descriptions, and proper categorization. The interface is designed for craftspeople, not tech experts."_

**[Screen: Show product creation with Hindi interface]**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/stores/products/add/`

_"This isn't just for solo sellers - even NGOs managing 10+ artisans can use this from day one with our cooperative management dashboard."_

_"Now the advanced customer experience - when customers register, they provide proper address details in separate fields, not just a text box like other platforms."_

**[Screen: Show customer registration with address fields]**

- **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/accounts/register/`

_"During checkout, customers can choose from saved addresses or add new ones - perfect for Indian families who ship to multiple locations. This feature usually only exists in costly enterprise systems ‚Äî but customers get it here, out of the box."_

**[Screen: Show multi-address checkout selection]**

- **Go to any store and click "Buy Now" on a product**

_"And here's the seller dashboard with comprehensive analytics - order management, sales tracking, and performance metrics that help artisans understand their business growth."_
