# üé¨ StoreLoop Loom Video Script - RECORDING VERSION

**Duration: 6 minutes | What to say and show**

---

## üéØ Opening Hook (0:00-0:30)

**SAY:** *"Hi! I'm going to show you StoreLoop - a complete e-commerce platform I built specifically for Indian artisans and small businesses. It has zero transaction fees, Hindi language support, GST compliance, and advanced features like multi-address customer management that Wix and Shopify don't offer."*

**SHOW:** Store listing page at `http://localhost:8000/stores/`

---

## üîç Problem Statement (0:30-1:00)

**SAY:** *"Existing platforms weren't built for Indian artisans. Wix charges 2.9% transaction fees, has no Hindi interface, and requires 20+ setup steps. Shopify costs $29/month - more than many artisans make. WooCommerce needs WordPress expertise most craftspeople don't have."*

*"None understand Indian needs - GST compliance, Hindi product descriptions, or multi-address delivery for joint families."*

*"So I built StoreLoop - zero fees, 4-step onboarding, Hindi language support, and advanced customer management. Built specifically for India's creative economy."*

**SHOW:** Create comparison slide or show StoreLoop vs competitor websites
